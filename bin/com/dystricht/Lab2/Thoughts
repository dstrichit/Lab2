//Accelerations is always positive in GravSystem.computeAcceleration();
//Figure out how to subtract acceleration... what pulls X back towards Earth, Y back towards earth... abs() problem?'
//******resolved but leaving this here for future reference******

Fixing the strange movements/unwanted velocities:

Each body has horizontal acceleration at the start
we iterate through each body and calculate acceleration caused by all other bodies
THE PROBLEM ARISES in that the next body in the timestep has it's acceleration calculated BASED ON the last body's.
